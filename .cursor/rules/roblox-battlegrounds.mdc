# Roblox Battlegrounds - Meme Auto-Battler Game

## Game Concept

A Roblox auto-battler game inspired by Hearthstone Battlegrounds where players collect and battle with meme-themed minions instead of fantasy creatures. Players compete to be the last one standing by strategically building their meme army.

## Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Draft Phase**: Players select minions from a tavern to add to their board
2. **Battle Phase**: Minions automatically fight against other players' boards
3. **Elimination**: Players are eliminated when their health reaches 0
4. **Victory**: Last player standing wins the game

## Minion Types (Tribes)

Instead of traditional fantasy tribes, use meme-based categories:

### Human Memes

- **Povar**: Povar character
- **Melon Tusk**: Meme version of Elon Musk

- **Tribe**: Their meme category (Human, Anime, Animal, Cartoon, Meme)
- **Ability**: Special effect that triggers under certain conditions
- **Tier**: Rarity/power level (1-6 stars)

## Tribal Synergies

## Technical Implementation

### Data Structures

```typescript
interface Minion {
	id: string;
	name: string;
	attack: number;
	health: number;
	tribe: MemeTribe;
	ability: MinionAbility;
	tier: number;
	image: string;
}

interface Player {
	userId: number;
	name: string;
	health: number;
	gold: number;
	tavernTier: number;
	board: Minion[];
	hand: Minion[];
	hero: Hero;
}

interface GameState {
	players: Player[];
	currentTurn: number;
	phase: GamePhase;
	roundNumber: number;
}
```

### Game Phases

1. **Lobby**: Players join and select heroes
2. **Draft**: Players buy minions and build their board
3. **Battle**: Minions fight automatically
4. **Results**: Damage calculation and elimination checks
5. **Cleanup**: Remove dead minions, award gold

### Battle Logic

- Minions attack in order (left to right)
- Random targeting for enemy minions
- Abilities trigger based on conditions
- Tribal synergies apply bonuses
- Battle continues until one side is eliminated

### AI for Single Player

- Computer players follow strategic patterns
- Focus on tribal synergies
- Upgrade tavern at appropriate times
- Balance between buying minions and upgrading

## UI/UX Considerations

- **Tavern Interface**: Grid of available minions to purchase
- **Board View**: Player's current minion lineup
- **Battle Animation**: Visual representation of minion fights
- **Tribe Indicators**: Clear visual cues for minion types
- **Synergy Display**: Show current tribal bonuses

- **Cosmetic Packs**: Special minion skins and effects
- **Tavern Themes**: Different visual styles for the shop
- **Emotes**: Battle taunts and celebrations
