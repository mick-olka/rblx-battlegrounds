# Roblox Battlegrounds - Meme Auto-Battler Game

## Game Concept

A Roblox auto-battler game inspired by Hearthstone Battlegrounds where players collect and battle with meme-themed minions instead of fantasy creatures. Players compete to be the last one standing by strategically building their meme army.

## Core Gameplay Loop

1. **Draft Phase**: Players select minions from a Shop to add to their board
2. **Battle Phase**: Players fight in pairs (their minions automatically fight each other)
3. **Elimination**: Players are eliminated when their health reaches 0
4. **Victory**: Last player standing wins the game

## Minion Types (Tribes)

Instead of traditional fantasy tribes, use meme-based categories:

### Human

- **Povar**: Povar character
- **Melon Tusk**: Meme version of Elon Musk

### Classic meme

- **Pepe the Frog**: Classic internet meme character
- **Wojak**: Sad/emotional meme character
- **Chad**: Confident/alpha male meme

### Anime

- **Chad Anime**: Confident anime character
- **Anime Girl**: Various anime female characters
- **Anime Boy**: Various anime male characters
- **Weeb**: Anime enthusiast stereotype
- **Saitama**: One Punch Man meme

### Animal

- **Doge**: Shiba Inu dog meme
- **Nyan Cat**: Flying cat with rainbow trail
- **Grumpy Cat**: Frowning cat meme
- **Duck**: Various duck memes
- **Frog**: Pepe and other frog memes

### Cartoon

- **SpongeBob**: Various SpongeBob characters
- **Rick & Morty**: Characters from the show
- **Family Guy**: Characters from the show
- **Simpsons**: Characters from the show
- **Adventure Time**: Characters from the show

### Brainrot

- **Bombardilo crocodilo**: Some viral brainrot meme

## Minion Stats & Abilities

Each minion has:

- **Attack**: Damage dealt in battle
- **Health**: How much damage they can take
- **Tribe**: Their meme category (Human, Anime, Animal, Cartoon, Brainrot)
- **Abilities**: Special effect that triggers under certain conditions (reborn, battlecry, curse, trigger, bait, bubble, poison, rage)
- **Tier**: Rarity/power level (1-6 stars)

## Minion abilities

- **Reborn**: After death, minion is returned to the field with 1 health
- **Battlecry**: Effect is triggered when minion is played (put on the table)
- **Curse**: Effect is triggered when minion is destroyed
- **Trigger**: Does something on attack
- **Bait**: Minion is being targeted first
- **Bubble**: Minion has a shield that can withstand any damage one time before breaking
- **Poison**: Any non-zero damage by this minion is lethal
- **Rage**: Minion attacks twice in a row if survived first attack

## Game Mechanics

### Shop Tiers

- **Tier 1**: Basic meme minions (1-star)
- **Tier 2**: Uncommon meme minions (2-star)
- **Tier 3**: Rare meme minions (3-star)
- **Tier 4**: Epic meme minions (4-star)
- **Tier 5**: Legendary meme minions (5-star)
- **Tier 6**: Mythic meme minions (6-star)

### Economy System

- **Coins**: Earned each turn, used to buy minions and upgrade Shop
- **Shop Upgrade Cost**: Increases with each tier but decreases by one every round
- **Minion Cost**: 3 coins
- **Selling**: Get 1 coin back when selling minions

### Battle System

- **Turn Order**: Random pairing each round
- **Attack Order**: Left to right, random targeting (prioritizing minions with bait ability)
- **Death**: Minions are removed when their health reaches 0
- **Damage**: Players take damage based on surviving enemy minions

### Hero Abilities (for version 1.1)

Each player chooses a hero with unique abilities:

- **Meme Lord**: Start with extra gold each turn
- **Viral Creator**: Minions cost less gold
- **Trend Setter**: Start with a random high-tier minion
- **Internet Historian**: Can roll twice
- **Meme Collector**: Gain bonuses for having diverse tribes

## Technical Implementation

### In-Match Data Structures

```typescript
interface Minion {
	id: string;
	name: string;
	attack: number;
	health: number;
	tribe: MemeTribe;
	ability: MinionAbility;
	tier: number;
	image: string;
}

interface Player {
	userId: number;
	name: string;
	health: number;
	gold: number;
	ShopTier: number;
	board: Minion[];
	hand: Minion[];
	hero: Hero;
}

interface GameState {
	players: Player[];
	currentTurn: number;
	phase: GamePhase;
	roundNumber: number;
}
```

### Game Phases

1. **Lobby**: Players join (and select heroes in version 1.1)
2. **Draft**: Players buy minions in the shop and build their board
3. **Battle**: Minions fight automatically
4. **Results**: Damage calculation and elimination checks
5. **Cleanup**: Remove dead players, award gold

### Battle Logic

- Minions attack in order (left to right)
- Random targeting for enemy minions (if no minions with bait)
- Abilities trigger based on conditions
- Tribal synergies apply bonuses
- Battle continues until one side is eliminated

### AI for Single Player

- Computer players follow strategic patterns
- Focus on tribal synergies
- Upgrade Shop at appropriate times
- Balance between buying minions and upgrading

## UI/UX Considerations

- **Shop Interface**: Grid of available minions to purchase
- **Board View**: Player's current minion lineup
- **Battle Animation**: Visual representation of minion fights
- **Tribe Indicators**: Clear visual cues for minion types
- **Synergy Display**: Show current tribal bonuses
- **Hero Selection**: Choose hero at game start

## Monetization Ideas

- **Battle Pass**: Seasonal rewards and exclusive minions
- **Cosmetic Packs**: Special minion skins and effects
- **Shop Themes**: Different visual styles for the Shop
- **Emotes**: Battle taunts and celebrations
- **Boosts**: Temporary advantages (use sparingly)

## Future Expansions

- **New Tribes**: Add more meme categories
- **Seasonal Events**: Limited-time minions and themes
- **Tournament Mode**: Competitive ranked play
- **Custom Games**: Private matches with friends
- **Minion Trading**: Exchange minions between players
- **Achievement System**: Unlock rewards for milestones

3. **Battle Engine**: Implement automatic combat
4. **Tribal Synergies**: Add tribe-based bonuses
5. **Hero Abilities**: Implement unique player powers
